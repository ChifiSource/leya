#  The Leya compiler
The Leya Compiler works by parsing spaced input into individual expressions that
create runtimes inside of the compiler. The base has a simple syntax for
creating two basic types. Arrays and values. Every value, whether function or
type, falls into the same types that stores the other. The only difference is that
the command call between the data in each element parse is applied to the types.
This command call position is also mutable, this means that you are able to
 modify the structures of your arrays. You may decide how your structure is
 stated with an argument.
## Plans
The thing about building a language is that most of the time, the language is not really used for anything. My intention with this language is of course never going to be to replace existing languages or fill market niche... I just thought this was a really awesome project -- that I did for fun, and I think other people might enjoy it. That being said, I do have some very interesting plans for what exactly the language will behave like in terms of paradigm, type system, things of this nature.
- Lisp-like
While the code in Leya is not meant to be Lisp-syntax compliant, as with the deprecated old version of Leya, the syntax will be Lisp-inspired. That being said, a huge difference is that whitespace is planned to be used syntactually.
- Polymorphic
Polymorphism is a programming concept that I have completely fallen in love with. With Leya, I would really like to take the multiple dispatch concept to another level with a good type system that can support a number of different types of data.
- Built in itself
The reason why this is a key focus of Leya is because Leya intends to keep speed by working off a simple strategy, the language itself will just be a high-level, memory managed version of Assembly that manages memory for you and has high-level syntax. In other words, just like in C we can interact with hardware, but unlike C, Leya will read more like a regular spoken language.
- JIT
Of course, all of these features are simply what I would call -- potential, but I think that JIT is a feature I could also certainly live with having in Leya.
