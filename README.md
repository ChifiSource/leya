#  The Leya compiler
The Leya Compiler works by parsing spaced input into individual expressions that
create runtimes inside of the compiler. The base has a simple syntax for
creating two basic types. Arrays and values. Every value, whether function or
type, falls into the same types that stores the other. The only difference is that
the command call between the data in each element parse is applied to the types.
This command call position is also mutable, this means that you are able to
 modify the structures of your arrays. You may decide how your structure is
 stated with an argument.
